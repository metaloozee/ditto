# Ditto

Ditto is a TanStack Start app deployed with Alchemy on Cloudflare Workers. It uses:

- Cloudflare D1 + Drizzle for persistence
- better-auth with GitHub OAuth
- GitHub repo import for projects
- `@cloudflare/sandbox` for workspace instantiation
- R2-backed sandbox backup/restore
- agent runs in the Cloudflare sandbox via the PI harness; the client streams
  `POST /api/agent/stream` (SSE)

## Repository layout

| Path | Ownership |
|---|---|
| Root (`package.json`, `alchemy.run.ts`, `Dockerfile`, `pnpm-workspace.yaml`) | Workspace orchestration, Alchemy deploy graph, sandbox image |
| `apps/web` | TanStack Start application (`@ditto/web`): UI, Worker routes, domain services, D1 schema/migrations |
| `packages/sandbox-runner` | Independent npm package baked into the sandbox image (not a pnpm workspace member) |

Alchemy is the sole deployment owner (`pnpm dev` / `pnpm deploy` / `pnpm destroy`). This monorepo layout does not introduce SST, Wrangler-as-deploy, or any other deployment boundary.

## Alchemy v2 (dev stage)

- Exact deps: `alchemy@2.0.0-beta.70`, `effect@4.0.0-beta.103`, `@effect/platform-node@4.0.0-beta.103` (workspace overrides pin the coherent Effect beta.103 set).
- Container id `sandbox`, env `Sandbox`; image from root `Dockerfile`.
- `pnpm dev` runs Alchemy from `apps/web` (entry `../../alchemy.run.ts`) so local Docker context resolves to the repo root. `pnpm deploy` / `pnpm destroy` stay root-level `--stage dev`.
- Local state: `.alchemy/` (gitignored). Stage is disposable.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 22.15+ for the app (22.19+ for the sandbox runner; 22.17+ recommended for local dev)
- pnpm (workspace root + `apps/web`) and npm (`packages/sandbox-runner` only)
- Cloudflare / GitHub credentials for the configured environment

## Install

Root workspace (pnpm; includes `apps/web`):

```bash
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
```

Sandbox runner is a **separate npm package** (not a pnpm workspace member). Install it when working on `packages/sandbox-runner` or before full verification:

```bash
npm ci --prefix packages/sandbox-runner
```

Or: `pnpm runner:install`.

## Development

From the repository root:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Runs Alchemy from `apps/web` against stage `dev` so the root Docker context
resolves correctly. Env files load from the repo root.

Before opening a PR, run the full verification gate (app + runner typecheck/tests/build):

```bash
pnpm verify
```

When you change `packages/sandbox-runner` sources, its `package.json` / lockfile,
or the root `Dockerfile`, rebuild the sandbox image so the Docker-baked runner
matches local code (restart `pnpm dev` or redeploy with Alchemy so the root
`Dockerfile` is rebuilt).

## Database

Generate migrations after changing `apps/web/src/db/schema.ts`:

```bash
pnpm db:generate
```

Migrations live under `apps/web/migrations`. Root `pnpm db:*` scripts forward to
`@ditto/web`.

## Scripts

- `pnpm dev` — local Alchemy + Vite for stage `dev` only
- `pnpm build` — production build of `@ditto/web`
- `pnpm deploy` — `alchemy deploy --stage dev` (sole deploy owner)
- `pnpm destroy` — `alchemy destroy --stage dev` (destructive; no continuity)
- `pnpm check` — Biome check (repo root)
- `pnpm lint` — Biome lint
- `pnpm format` — Biome format
- `pnpm test` — Vitest for `@ditto/web`
- `pnpm typecheck` — TypeScript for `@ditto/web` (`tsc --noEmit`)
- `pnpm runner:install` — `npm ci` for `packages/sandbox-runner`
- `pnpm runner:verify` — typecheck, test, and build the sandbox runner
- `pnpm verify` — full pre-PR gate (check, typecheck, test, build, runner verify)
- `pnpm db:generate` / `db:migrate` / `db:push` / `db:pull` / `db:studio` — Drizzle via `@ditto/web`

## Docker / sandbox image

The root `Dockerfile` copies `packages/sandbox-runner` into the Cloudflare sandbox
image and installs the `ditto-runner` CLI. Build context is the repository root
(see `.dockerignore`).

## Environment variables

Set these for local development and deployment (typically `.env.local` at the
repo root; Vite `envDir` is the monorepo root):

```env
CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID=
R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID=
R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=
USE_LOCAL_BUCKET_BACKUPS=
BETTER_AUTH_SECRET=
BETTER_AUTH_URL=
GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=
GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=
GITHUB_APP_ID=
GITHUB_APP_PRIVATE_KEY=
VITE_GITHUB_APP_INSTALL_URL=
OPENCODE_API_KEY=
AI_CREDENTIALS_ENCRYPTION_KEY=
```

`BETTER_AUTH_URL` defaults to `http://localhost:5173` if omitted.
`AI_CREDENTIALS_ENCRYPTION_KEY` must be nonempty and distinct from
`BETTER_AUTH_SECRET`. It encrypts account-level AI provider credentials.
`OPENCODE_API_KEY` is the operator credential for the free fallback model
`opencode/deepseek-v4-flash-free` only. Users connect their own providers in
Account Settings.

## Notes

- For GitHub-linked projects, the Ditto GitHub App needs **Contents: Read &
  write** and **Pull requests: Read & write** so the Worker can push session
  branches and open pull requests (installation token; never stored in the DB).
- `pnpm deploy` and `pnpm destroy` are managed through Alchemy only, stage
  `dev` only.
- `apps/web/src/server.ts` exports the Cloudflare Sandbox binding used by the app.
- `OPENCODE_API_KEY` is required as the operator fallback for
  `opencode/deepseek-v4-flash-free`. Account provider credentials are injected
  ephemerally via `DITTO_PI_CREDENTIAL` and deleted inside the runner before
  tools start.
- Agent harness architecture: `docs/architecture/agent-harness.md`
- Concurrent agent runs per project are not enforced yet; see the architecture
  doc for deferred concurrency notes.
